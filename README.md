# Logistic Regression for Breast Cancer Prediction

This project demonstrates how Logistic Regression can be used to classify breast cancer tumors as **benign** or **malignant** based on real-world data.

It contains:
- An implementation of Logistic Regression using **Scikit-learn**.
- A **manual implementation** of Logistic Regression from scratch using **NumPy**.
